# asassn-14li
Image analysis pipeline. 

ASASSN-14li was a tidal disruption event (TDE) that was follow-up imaged by the Liverpool Telescope. 

This python jupyter notebook, with C dependencies, was an image analysis pipeline created for my MSc Astrophysics dissertation (2022/2023). 

I make use of Astromatic's SExtractor, SCAMP and SWarp routines.
